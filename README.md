Use Q9_b.csv


Q11)  Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?

    
Q12)  Below are the scores obtained by a student in tests 
34,36,36,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,41,42,42,45,49,56
1)	Find mean, median, variance, standard deviation.
2)	What can we say about the student marks? 



Q 20) Calculate probability from the given dataset for the below cases
Data _set: Cars.csv
Calculate the probability of MPG  of Cars for the below cases.
       MPG <- Cars$MPG
a.	P(MPG>38)
b.	P(MPG<40)
c.    P (20<MPG<50)





Q 21) Check whether the data follows normal distribution
a)	Check whether the MPG of Cars follows Normal Distribution 
        Dataset: Cars.csv
b)	Check Whether the Adipose Tissue (AT) and Waist Circumference(Waist)  from wc-at data set  follows Normal Distribution 
       Dataset: wc-at.csv


Q22)Calculate the Z scores of  90% confidence interval,94% confidence interval, 60% confidence interval 


Q23)Calculate the t scores of 95% confidence interval, 96% confidence interval, 99% confidence interval for sample size of 25

       
Q24)A Government  company claims that an average light bulb lasts 270 days. A researcher randomly selects 18 bulbs for testing. The sampled bulbs last an average of 260 days, with a standard deviation of 90 days. If the CEO's claim were true, what is the probability that 18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days
Hint:  
   rcode   pt(tscore,df)  
 df  degrees of freedom
